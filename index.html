    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          In the simplest case, you can add a search filter to any table. By default, this
          example will filter all rows in the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>
          section of a <code>&lt;table class="sieve"&gt;</code>.
        </p>

        <pre>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("table.sieve").sieve();
}); </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          To filter a list of paragraphs, override
          the <code>itemSelector</code> option. This example will filter
          all <code>&ltp&gt;</code> elements within
          the <code>&lt;section class="sieve"&gt;</code> container.
        </p>

        <pre>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("section.sieve").sieve({ itemSelector: "p" });
}); </pre>
or
        <pre>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("section.sieve").sieve({ searchInput: $("select#myid"),itemSelector: "p" });
}); </pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In either case, Sieve will insert a search box before the content
    container and act as an interactive search filter for the content.</p>


    <h2>Demos</h2>
    <p>
      Start typing in one of the search fields to filter the associated
      datasets.
